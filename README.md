**Solution 1 : Trapezoid formula**  
Created a function named "caculatedOddRage" and would return the sum of the odd numbers in the range of the first and second input variables. The first input variable was the starting number so it must be smaller than the second variable. Moreover, we only calculated positive numbers. Finally, used trapezoid formula to calculated the sum.  
Entering any invalid numbers would return "-1" and printed a warming message. This function would accept all range numbers.
  
**Solution 2: for loop**  
Use for loop to check every numbers in the given range.
If the number was not divisible by 2, added them together.

## Result Analysis
Solution 1 used less operations so it would much faster than solution 2. The performance gap would be more obvious when we used a larger range.
